%     Mesh refinement
%     Convergence study
%     fluid and boundary together
%     timestep
%     k, force, force density(should converge to sth),delta s, 
%     bdry and target points, k constant
    
%   measure error norms, target points, integral, fluid fields
%   save system state, to restart simulation
%   factors of 2

% fortran (prob easier, vector) / C / C++, parallelize,
% parallelizing ibm code, journal of supercomputing, interp, spread
% snappy, crunchy matlab,

% stiffness, derivatives, bending stiffness
% walls later top bottom, set velocity to zero at time steps, 2 meshwidths, tether
% points

% Testing Code, 
% Fluid solver, take results, and substitute into equations, physical space
% complications: get pressure, check each step, 
% save information, 
% ghost cells, checking transparent, check with random numbers
% checks for delta functions properties. strategy: 
% check force/ torque(periodicity) identitites with spread, random points,
% interp :  1. constant and linear functions exactly,
%           2.  second order accurate , smooth periodic function
% Force  :  1. based on energy functions
